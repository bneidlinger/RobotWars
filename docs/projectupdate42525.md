# Project Update: Server Backend, API Integration, and Render Deployment

**Date:** 2024-07-28

**Objective:** Transition RobotWars from a client-side localStorage-based system to a robust server-side backend using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL for persistent user data (accounts, snippets, loadouts). Deploy the updated application to Render, replacing the previous static deployment.

**Work Completed:**

**1. Backend Foundation (Server-Side):**
    *   **Database:** Defined PostgreSQL schema for `users`, `code_snippets`, `loadout_configs`, and `session` tables, including relevant constraints and relationships.
    *   **Server Setup:** Initialized Node.js/Express server (`server/index.js`).
    *   **Dependencies:** Added and configured `pg`, `bcrypt`, `express`, `express-session`, `connect-pg-simple`, `dotenv`.
    *   **DB Connection:** Implemented connection pool using `pg` (`server/db.js`), configured via `DATABASE_URL`.
    *   **Session Management:** Configured `express-session` with `connect-pg-simple` to store sessions in the PostgreSQL `session` table. Secured session cookies and shared middleware with Socket.IO.
    *   **Authentication API (`server/routes/auth.js`):**
        *   Implemented `POST /api/auth/register`: Handles user creation, password hashing (`bcrypt`), checks for existing users (409), and database transaction for user + default snippet insertion.
        *   Implemented `POST /api/auth/login`: Handles user lookup, password comparison (`bcrypt.compare`), and session regeneration.
        *   Implemented `POST /api/auth/logout`: Handles session destruction.
        *   Implemented `GET /api/auth/me`: Checks current session status.
    *   **Data APIs (`server/routes/snippets.js`, `server/routes/loadouts.js`):**
        *   Implemented CRUD endpoints for managing user-specific code snippets and loadout configurations.
        *   Utilized database transactions where necessary (e.g., saving loadouts needing snippet IDs).
        *   Included joins to retrieve related data (e.g., snippet names for loadouts).
        *   Used `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` for efficient create/update operations.
        *   Added checks (e.g., preventing snippet deletion if used by a loadout).
    *   **Authorization:** Applied custom authentication middleware (`server/middleware/auth.js`) to protect data API routes, ensuring only logged-in users can access their data via session checks.
    *   **Default Snippets:** Implemented automatic creation of default code snippets in the database upon user registration (`POST /api/auth/register`).

**2. Client-Side Integration:**
    *   **Auth UI & Flow:**
        *   Added HTML modals for Login/Registration (`client/index.html`).
        *   Created `AuthHandler` class (`client/js/auth.js`) to manage login state, modal display, API calls (`apiCall` helper), and coordinate post-login/logout actions.
        *   Modified application startup (`client/js/main.js`) to defer UI display/network connection until successful authentication.
        *   Updated header to display logged-in username and logout button.
    *   **API Data Integration:**
        *   Refactored `client/js/ui/controls.js` and `client/js/ui/loadoutBuilder.js` to remove `LocalStorageManager` dependency.
        *   Replaced local storage operations with asynchronous `apiCall` functions targeting the new backend API endpoints (`/api/snippets`, `/api/loadouts`).
        *   Implemented local caching (`cachedLoadouts`, `cachedSnippets`) in `LoadoutBuilder` for efficient UI population after API fetches.
        *   Updated `LoadoutBuilder` event handlers to work with API data and structures.
    *   **Loadout / Game Start Flow:**
        *   Fixed UI controls (`Ready Up`, `Test Code`, editor buttons) remaining disabled after initial loadout configuration by ensuring correct UI state transitions (`Controls.setState`). (Covered in `projectupdate424252321.md`)
        *   Implemented `Controls._prepareLoadoutData` to fetch code snippet content via API (`GET /api/snippets/:snippetName`) and assemble the full loadout data (`name`, `visuals`, `code`) needed by the server. (Covered in `projectupdate424252321.md`)
        *   Corrected server-side `socket-handler.js` to pass the full `loadoutData` (not just `userId`) to `GameManager.startTestGameForPlayer`, fixing test game initialization failures. (Covered in `projectupdate424252321.md`)

**3. Render Deployment:**
    *   **PostgreSQL Database:** Created a new PostgreSQL instance on Render, selecting appropriate region and plan.
    *   **Web Service:** Created a new Node.js Web Service on Render linked to the GitHub repository.
        *   Configured Build Command (`npm install`) and Start Command (`npm start`).
        *   **Crucially:** Set necessary Environment Variables:
            *   `DATABASE_URL`: Set to the **Internal Connection String** from the Render PostgreSQL instance.
            *   `SESSION_SECRET`: Set to a strong, randomly generated secret.
            *   `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`.
    *   **Database Schema Initialization:** Connected to the Render PostgreSQL database externally (using `psql` via command line). Executed `CREATE TABLE` SQL scripts to create the `users`, `code_snippets`, `loadout_configs`, and `session` tables with appropriate columns, constraints (UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY), and triggers.
    *   **Deployment Trigger:** Pushed committed code changes to GitHub, triggering automatic deployment on Render.

**4. Post-Deployment Troubleshooting Log:**
    *   **Initial 502 Bad Gateway:** Encountered after first deployment post-schema setup. Diagnosed as the server starting but likely crashing due to missing tables needed for session/API calls. Resolved by successfully executing the `CREATE TABLE` scripts on the Render database and redeploying/restarting the service.
    *   **Registration 500/409 Errors & Server Crash:** Server logs revealed:
        *   A `409 Conflict` ("Username already taken") during registration was followed by a server crash due to a "Double Release" error in `server/routes/auth.js`. Fixed by removing the premature `client.release()` call before the `finally` block.
        *   A `500 Internal Server Error` during registration was caused by concurrent requests leading to a `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "users_username_key"` error (PostgreSQL code `23505`). Improved error handling in the `catch` block to specifically return a `409` for this constraint violation instead of a generic `500`.
    *   **Login 401 Errors:** Encountered "Invalid credentials" errors, indicating password mismatch during login attempts. Advised verification of credentials or user reset.
    *   **Post-Login 401 Errors (Builder Load):** Client failed API calls (`/api/loadouts`, `/api/snippets`) immediately after successful login/registration, receiving 401 Unauthorized.
        *   **Attempt 1 (Delay):** Added a `setTimeout` delay in `AuthHandler._onLoginSuccess` before showing the `LoadoutBuilder`. This did not fully resolve the issue.
        *   **Attempt 2 (Auth Retry):** Modified `LoadoutBuilder.show` to first call `/api/auth/me` to verify session validity. If the check failed, it would retry a few times with delays before populating dropdowns. This *also* failed, with the `/api/auth/me` call itself returning unauthorized (`[Builder Show] Auth check failed after login!`).
    *   **Socket.IO 400 Errors:** Observed during initial connection phases, likely related to session handshake issues stemming from the core HTTP auth problems. Left pending until HTTP auth is stable.

**Current Status:**

*   The application successfully deploys to Render.
*   The Node.js server starts and connects to the Render PostgreSQL database.
*   Database tables (`users`, `code_snippets`, `loadout_configs`, `session`) exist on Render.
*   User registration (`POST /api/auth/register`) **appears functional on the server-side** according to logs (user created, snippets created, session created). Server crashes related to registration seem resolved.
*   User login (`POST /api/auth/login`) works if correct credentials are provided.
*   **Critical Issue:** Immediately following a successful registration/login, the client-side flow fails. The `LoadoutBuilder.show` method calls `/api/auth/me` to verify the session, but this check fails (`[Builder Show] Auth check failed after login!`), preventing the builder from fetching and displaying the user's initial loadout configurations and default code snippets. This indicates a persistent problem with the session cookie being recognized or available for the very first authenticated API requests after login/registration, *even with the retry logic*.
*   **Related Issue:** The user reported that using "Quick Start" also leads to a "not connected to server" error when trying to start a test session, suggesting potential issues with WebSocket connection establishment or state management post-Quick Start as well.

**Known Issues / Next Steps:**

*   **Primary Focus:** Investigate why the `GET /api/auth/me` call within `LoadoutBuilder.show` is failing immediately after login/registration, despite server logs indicating successful session creation.
    *   **Action:** Use browser developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the failing `/api/auth/me` request. Specifically check: Are the correct request headers being sent? Crucially, is the `Cookie` header containing the `connect.sid` session ID present on this *specific* request?
    *   **Action:** Add more detailed server-side logging within the `/api/auth/me` route handler itself in `server/routes/auth.js`. Log `req.session` *before* checking `req.session.userId` to see if the session object exists but is empty, or if it's missing entirely for that request.
    *   **Action:** Consider alternative session verification flows if direct cookie propagation remains unreliable immediately post-login (though this shouldn't normally be necessary).
*   **Secondary Focus:** Diagnose the "not connected to server" error when attempting "Test Code" after using "Quick Start". Does the WebSocket connect successfully after Quick Start? Is the client state (`Controls.uiState`) correct?
*   **Code Cleanup:** Review and potentially remove redundant session/login checks now that `authMiddleware` is in place on the server.
*   **API TODOs:** Implement the "last used loadout" preference API endpoints and client integration. Fully wire up the "Ready Up" flow in `Controls.js` using `_prepareLoadoutData` once the underlying loadout/snippet fetching is reliable.
