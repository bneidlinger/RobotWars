# Project Update: Audio Integration & Test Workflow Debugging

**Phase Objective:** Integrate background music, resolve audio loading issues for sound effects, and diagnose/fix incorrect code execution during test games.

**Technical Accomplishments:**

1.  **Audio System Integration & Fixes:**
    *   **Background Music Added:** Integrated an HTML `<audio>` element (`soundtrack.mp3`) and a UI volume toggle button (ðŸ”Š/ðŸ”‡) with CSS styling.
    *   **AudioManager Enhancements:** Updated `AudioManager.js` to manage music state (defaulting to unmuted), persist mute preference in `localStorage`, and handle playback requests.
    *   **Path Correction:** Identified and corrected incorrect audio file paths referenced in `index.html` and `AudioManager.js` (changed `/assets/audio/` to the correct `/assets/sounds/`), resolving server 404/blank page errors when accessing audio files directly.
    *   **Autoplay Policy Resolved:** Fixed the `NotAllowedError: play() failed because the user didn't interact...` for background music. Playback is now successfully initiated within the user interaction context of the Loadout Builder's "Save & Enter Lobby" or "Quick Start" buttons, or the main volume toggle button.
    *   **Sound Effects Functional:** With path corrections, pre-existing sound effects (`fire.mp3`, `hit.mp3`, `explosion.mp3`) are now loading and playing correctly during gameplay simulation.

2.  **Test Game Code Execution Debugging:**
    *   **Issue Identified:** Users reported that clicking "Test Code" sometimes executed outdated or incorrect robot code (specifically, often defaulting to "Simple Tank" logic), even when different code was selected or visible in the main editor.
    *   **Debugging Implemented:** Added detailed logging on both client (`Controls._prepareLoadoutData`) and server (`ServerRobotInterpreter.initialize`) to trace the exact code content being fetched, sent, received, and compiled for test games.
    *   **Root Cause Diagnosed:** Confirmed via logs that the "Test Code" flow correctly fetches code via API based on the `codeLoadoutName` associated with the *Loadout Builder's currently active state*. The issue arises because changing the snippet dropdown *below the main editor* or modifying code *in the editor* does **not** update this underlying state used by the "Test Code" button. The test runs the code linked to the loadout, not the live editor code.

**Current Status:**

*   Audio system (background music and sound effects) is fully functional.
*   The mechanism causing incorrect code execution during test games is understood â€“ it uses the saved/linked snippet code, not the live editor code.
*   Test games using code explicitly selected and saved via the Loadout Builder workflow function correctly.

**Identified Issue / Next Steps:**

*   **UX Improvement Needed for "Test Code":** The current behavior where "Test Code" ignores the live code in the editor and uses the snippet linked to the active loadout is counter-intuitive for rapid testing and debugging. Users expect to test the code they are currently looking at/editing.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Modify the "Test Code" workflow:
    *   When the "Test Code" button is clicked, `Controls._prepareLoadoutData` should **skip** fetching code via API based on `codeLoadoutName`.
    *   Instead, it should retrieve the code *directly* from the live CodeMirror editor instance (`editor.getValue()`).
    *   This live code should be sent to the server as part of the `loadoutData` payload specifically for the `'requestTestGame'` event.
    *   The server-side logic for test games will then compile and run this directly provided code.
    *   **(Note:** The "Ready Up" flow for actual matchmaking should continue to use the code from the saved snippet linked to the chosen loadout configuration).
*   **Action Item:** Implement the proposed solution to make the "Test Code" button use the live editor content.
