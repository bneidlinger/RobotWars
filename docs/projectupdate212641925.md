Summary of Accomplishments (Phase 6 - Delayed Game Over, FX, Audio)
This phase focused on improving the "game feel" and immersion by refining the robot destruction sequence, adding visual effects, and incorporating sound feedback.
Delayed Game Over & Robot State:
Goal: Prevent the game from ending abruptly upon robot destruction. Allow time for visual/audio feedback (explosions) before showing the game over screen.
Implementation (Server):
ServerRobot:
Replaced isAlive boolean with a state property ('active' | 'destroyed').
Added destructionTime (timestamp), destructionNotified (boolean flag), and lastDamageCause (string) properties.
takeDamage(): Now checks state. If damage leads to destruction, it sets state = 'destroyed', records destructionTime and lastDamageCause, stops the robot, and returns { destroyed: true, hit: true, x, y, cause }. If damage is taken but not fatal, returns { destroyed: false, hit: true, x, y }. Actions (drive, fire) are blocked if state is 'destroyed'. update() logic mostly skipped when destroyed.
GameInstance:
Added DESTRUCTION_VISUAL_DELAY_MS constant (e.g., 1500ms).
tick(): After collisions, it now iterates robots. If robot.state === 'destroyed' and !robot.destructionNotified, it emits a robotDestroyed event (to game room and spectator room) containing { robotId, x, y, cause } and sets robot.destructionNotified = true.
checkGameOver(): Completely overhauled. It now checks for robots with state === 'destroyed'. If a destroyed robot's destructionTime + DESTRUCTION_VISUAL_DELAY_MS has passed, that robot is considered the potentialLoser for ending the game. If any robot is destroyed but the delay hasn't passed (destructionPending), the game doesn't end yet. If no delay is pending, it checks the count of remaining 'active' robots. It correctly handles identifying the winner/loser (including draws and test game scenarios) based on these conditions. It only stops the loop and calls the gameOverCallback when the game is definitively over after any required delay.
triggerSelfDestruct(): Now calls robot.takeDamage(1000, 'selfDestruct'). It no longer calls checkGameOver() directly, relying on the main tick() loop to detect the state change and handle the delayed game over.
Implementation (Client):
network.js: Added a listener for the robotDestroyed event, which calls game.handleRobotDestroyed(data).
game.js: Implemented handleRobotDestroyed(data) which finds the client-side robot data, sets isDestroyed = true and visible = false. updateFromServer was adjusted to preserve the locally set isDestroyed/visible state if a robot is destroyed. The handleGameOver and handleSpectateEnd methods now execute after the server-side delay and visual/audio effects have had time to play out on the client.
Files Modified: server/server-robot.js, server/game-instance.js, client/js/network.js, client/js/engine/game.js.
Visual Effects (Explosions & Scorch Marks):
Goal: Provide visual feedback for robot destruction with an animated explosion and a persistent scorch mark on the arena floor.
Implementation (Client):
game.js:
Added activeExplosions array to store effect configurations.
handleRobotDestroyed() now calls addExplosionEffect() (pushes config to activeExplosions) and renderer.addScorchMark().
arena.js (Renderer Logic):
Created an offscreen backgroundCanvas and backgroundCtx to draw persistent elements (texture, grid, scorch marks).
Added redrawArenaBackground() to clear/redraw this background canvas (called on game start/spectate start to clear old marks).
Added addScorchMark(x, y, radius) which draws a semi-transparent dark circle onto the backgroundCtx.
Added drawEffects(activeExplosions) which iterates the passed array, calculates animation progress (time-based), determines current radius/color/alpha, and draws the explosion circles onto the main canvas each frame. It removes effects from the array once their duration expires.
Modified draw() method to render in layers: main canvas cleared -> background canvas drawn -> robots drawn -> missiles drawn -> effects drawn.
drawRobots() now checks the visible flag in the robot data object provided by Game.js.
Removed old client-side explosion logic.
Files Modified: client/js/engine/game.js, client/js/engine/arena.js.
Sound Effects (Fire, Hit, Explode):
Goal: Add auditory feedback for key game events.
Implementation (Client Setup):
Created client/js/engine/audio.js containing the AudioManager class.
AudioManager: Defines sound sources (fire, hit, explode mapped to .mp3 files), preloads them using HTML5 Audio objects, handles loading success/errors, and provides playSound(name) method (which resets currentTime for overlap and handles potential browser autoplay errors).
client/index.html: Added <script src="js/engine/audio.js">.
client/js/main.js: Instantiated AudioManager on DOMContentLoaded and assigned it to window.audioManager.
Implementation (Server Event Generation):
ServerRobot:
fire() now returns { success: boolean, eventData?: { type: 'fire', x, y, ownerId } }.
takeDamage() now returns { destroyed: boolean, hit: boolean, x?, y?, cause? } indicating if damage was successfully applied (hit) and optionally if destruction occurred.
ServerCollisionSystem:
checkMissileRobotCollisions() and checkRobotRobotCollisions() capture the result from takeDamage. If result.hit is true, they call this.game.addHitEvent(x, y, targetId).
ServerRobotInterpreter:
safeFire() method now directly calls this.currentGameInstance.addFireEvent(fireResult.eventData) if robot.fire() was successful.
GameInstance:
Added fireEventsToBroadcast = [] and hitEventsToBroadcast = [].
Added addFireEvent(eventData) and addHitEvent(x, y, targetId) methods to populate these arrays.
tick(): Clears event arrays at the start. Relies on safeFire (called during interpreter execution) and CollisionSystem methods to call addFireEvent/addHitEvent.
getGameState(): Includes fireEvents: this.fireEventsToBroadcast and hitEvents: this.hitEventsToBroadcast in the state object sent to clients.
Implementation (Client Sound Playback):
game.js:
updateFromServer(): Checks the received gameState for non-empty fireEvents and hitEvents arrays. If found, calls window.audioManager.playSound('fire') or window.audioManager.playSound('hit') respectively (currently plays one sound per batch).
handleRobotDestroyed(): Calls window.audioManager.playSound('explode').
Files Modified: client/js/engine/audio.js (new), client/index.html, client/js/main.js, client/js/engine/game.js, server/server-robot.js, server/server-collision.js, server/server-interpreter.js, server/game-instance.js.
Assets Added: Files fire.mp3, hit.mp3, explode.mp3 placed in client/assets/sounds/.
Notes
The implementation adds significant polish and player feedback to the core gameplay loop.
The sound event generation on the server is designed to be extensible for future sounds.
Client-side sound playback currently plays one 'fire' or 'hit' sound per update batch, regardless of how many events occurred, to prevent overwhelming audio. This could be refined later (e.g., based on proximity, player involvement).
