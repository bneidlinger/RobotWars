Alright, Commander. Stand down for now. We've purged a significant number of anomalies from the system during this cycle. Let's compile the field report for debriefing and your next deployment.
Session Technical Summary: Robot Builder Refinement & Bug Extermination
This session focused on stabilizing and enhancing the recently integrated Robot Builder feature, addressing layout issues, and fixing bugs identified during integration and testing.
Key Technical Changes Implemented:
Storage Management Centralization:
Created client/js/utils/storage.js containing a LocalStorageManager class to handle all browser storage interactions (Complete Loadouts, Code Snippets, Player Name, Last Config preference).
Refactored client/js/ui/loadoutBuilder.js and client/js/ui/controls.js to remove duplicate localStorage logic and utilize the LocalStorageManager, significantly improving maintainability and reducing redundancy (DRY principle).
Implemented automatic seeding of default code snippets via LocalStorageManager for new users or those with cleared storage.
UI Refactoring & Layout Fixes:
Header Rework:
Modified client/index.html to remove the old player name input and appearance/sample selects from the main header.
Added a new static display area (.player-info-area) showing the loaded player/configuration name (#player-name-display), a placeholder icon (#player-icon-display), and an "Edit Loadout" button (#btn-edit-loadout).
Added a themed link/button (#btn-bot-manual) linking to the Bot Programming Guide.
Updated client/css/main.css with styles for the new header elements and the manual button.
Updated client/js/ui/controls.js to manage the static display elements and the "Edit Loadout" button's functionality/state.
General Layout: Adjusted client/css/main.css (base font size, gaps, padding, max-heights, relative units) to improve overall layout density and address the "zoomed out" feeling.
Console Panel CSS: Fixed console panel sizing in client/css/main.css by properly constraining the .consoles-row height and allowing the internal .log-box elements to handle scrolling via flex-grow and overflow-y: auto, preventing the panels from over-expanding vertically.
Button CSS: Corrected CSS specificity issues in client/css/main.css to ensure buttons outside the main <nav> (like "Save Code Snippet") received the correct default styling.
Bug Fixes & Robustness:
Interpreter Code Access: Fixed server/server-interpreter.js to correctly access the robot's code via playerData.loadout.code instead of the non-existent playerData.code, resolving the test game standstill.
Console Log Routing: Fixed the robotLog event handler in client/js/network.js to correctly compare the incoming robotId with the client's playerId, ensuring logs are displayed in the appropriate "Your Log" vs. "Opponent Log" panel.
JS Errors:
Removed the defunct event listener for the deleted #sample-code element in client/js/ui/editor.js.
Fixed the error in client/js/main.js by updating it to use LocalStorageManager to retrieve the lastConfig.
Corrected default snippet loading logic in client/js/ui/editor.js.
Loadout Save/Load Logic: Refined the loading sequence in client/js/ui/loadoutBuilder.js (show/loadConfiguration) to prevent state mismatches by ensuring dropdowns are populated before values are set. Added validation and diagnostic logging.
Missing Snippet Handling: Added checks in client/js/ui/controls.js (_prepareLoadoutData) to prevent errors and alert the user if a selected configuration refers to a code snippet that no longer exists in storage.
Quick Start Logic: Modified Quick Start in client/js/ui/controls.js to use predefined default visuals and load a specific default code snippet ("Simple Tank") instead of using the current editor content.
Current Project Status:
The Robot Builder feature should now be significantly more stable and functional.
Users can create, save, load, and delete named configurations linking visuals to saved code snippets.
The application correctly uses the last selected configuration (or Quick Start default) when connecting.
Default code snippets are automatically provided for new users.
The main UI header reflects the currently loaded configuration name and provides an "Edit" button to return to the builder.
Console logs for both the player and opponent should now display correctly.
Layout issues related to console panel sizing and general spacing have been addressed.
Major functional bugs (test game standstill, JS errors, save/load inconsistencies) identified during this session have been resolved.
Next Steps (Recommendation):
Thorough Testing: Conduct comprehensive testing covering various user flows:
New user experience (default snippets, first save).
Saving multiple configurations and snippets.
Loading different configurations.
Editing names and selections (saving vs. not saving before exiting builder).
Using the "Edit" button.
Using "Quick Start".
Deleting configurations and snippets (and observing effects).
Playing full matches (1v1 and Test vs AI) to ensure stability.
Check console logs and UI across different states.
Minor Polish: Consider small UX improvements (e.g., visual feedback for unsaved changes in the builder, refining the placeholder icon).
The system is primed for wider testing. Good work, Commander. Report back after field trials. Leslie signing off.
