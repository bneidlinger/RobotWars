## Project Tech Update: Server-Side Authentication & Storage Implementation (Phase 1 & 2)

**Objective:** Transition from fragile client-side `localStorage` for user identity, code snippets, and loadout configurations to a robust server-side system backed by a database. This addresses state management issues, ensures data persistence, and provides a foundation for user accounts.

**Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Server-Side)**

*   **Goal:** Set up the server infrastructure for user accounts and data storage.
*   **Database (PostgreSQL):**
    *   Defined SQL schema for `users` (username, password\_hash), `code_snippets` (user\_id, name, code), `loadout_configs` (user\_id, config\_name, visuals, code\_snippet\_id), and `session` tables. Includes foreign keys, unique constraints, and indexes.
    *   Configured local PostgreSQL setup for development testing.
*   **Server (`server/index.js` & Core Modules):**
    *   **Dependencies:** Added `pg`, `bcrypt`, `express-session`, `connect-pg-simple`, `dotenv`.
    *   **Database Connection (`server/db.js`):** Implemented a connection pool manager using `pg`, configured via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (supports `.env` locally).
    *   **Session Management:** Configured `express-session` to use `connect-pg-simple` for storing session data in the PostgreSQL `session` table. Set secure cookie options and shared session middleware with Socket.IO (`io.engine.use(sessionMiddleware)`).
    *   **Middleware:** Added `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` for request body parsing. Created `server/middleware/auth.js` to protect API routes (checks `req.session.userId`).
*   **Authentication API (`server/routes/auth.js`):**
    *   Implemented `POST /api/auth/register`: Validates input, checks for existing username (returns `409 Conflict`), hashes password with `bcrypt`, inserts new user, optionally creates session.
    *   Implemented `POST /api/auth/login`: Validates input, finds user, compares submitted password with stored hash using `bcrypt.compare`, regenerates session on success, stores `userId` and `username` in session. Returns `401 Unauthorized` on failure.
    *   Implemented `POST /api/auth/logout`: Destroys the server-side session and clears the session cookie.
    *   Implemented `GET /api/auth/me`: Checks `req.session.userId` to report current login status and user info.
*   **API Route Placeholders:** Created placeholder files (`server/routes/snippets.js`, `server/routes/loadouts.js`) and included them in `server/index.js`, protected by the auth middleware.

**Phase 2: Client-Side Integration (Auth UI & Flow)**

*   **Goal:** Implement UI for login/registration, connect it to the backend API, and adjust the application's startup flow to require authentication.
*   **HTML (`client/index.html`):**
    *   Added hidden modal dialogs (`#login-modal`, `#register-modal`) with forms for username/password input.
    *   Added a `#btn-logout` button to the header (initially hidden).
    *   Renamed Loadout Builder inputs to distinguish "Robot Name" (`#builder-robot-name`) from "Config Name" (`#config-name-input`).
    *   Added an "Appearance Presets" dropdown (`#builder-preset-select`) to the builder.
    *   Corrected script loading order to ensure dependencies are met (e.g., `controls.js` before `auth.js`).
*   **CSS (`client/css/main.css`):**
    *   Added styles for the authentication modals and their content/forms/buttons.
*   **Authentication Logic (`client/js/auth.js`):**
    *   Created functions for modal control (`showModal`, `closeModal`).
    *   Implemented `apiCall` helper function using `fetch` to interact with backend auth endpoints (includes `credentials: 'include'` for cookies).
    *   Added form submission handlers (`handleLogin`, `handleRegister`) and logout button handler (`handleLogout`) that use `apiCall`.
    *   Manages client-side login state (`isLoggedIn`, `window.currentUser`).
    *   Created `updateAuthState` to show/hide UI based on login status (Logout button, main game container) and update the header text with the **Account Username**.
    *   On `DOMContentLoaded`, checks `/api/auth/me` to determine initial state. If logged out, shows login modal; if logged in, calls `onLoginSuccess`.
    *   `onLoginSuccess` now triggers showing the **Loadout Builder** (`loadoutBuilderInstance.show()`) and connects the WebSocket.
    *   `onLogoutSuccess` disconnects WebSocket, hides main UI and builder, clears state, and shows the login modal.
    *   Resolved function hoisting issues by moving `DOMContentLoaded` listener to the end of the file.
*   **Main Logic (`client/js/main.js`):**
    *   Removed the unconditional call to `loadoutBuilder.show()`; initial view is now determined solely by `auth.js`.
*   **Controls (`client/js/controls.js`):**
    *   `updatePlayerHeaderDisplay` now only responsible for updating the header *icon* based on the selected loadout config (logic still uses temporary `localStorage` pending API implementation). The header *name* is handled by `auth.js`.
    *   Removed initial call to `updatePlayerHeaderDisplay` from constructor.
    *   Temporarily disabled core logic in `_prepareLoadoutData` and related button actions (`Ready Up`, `Test Code`) as they require fetching data from the server API (not yet implemented).
*   **Builder (`client/js/loadoutBuilder.js`):**
    *   Updated variable names and internal state to reflect "Robot Name" vs. "Config Name".
    *   `loadConfiguration` updated to handle loading the specific `robotName` into its input field.
    *   Save/Load/Delete/Enter Lobby handlers updated internally for new naming (still use temporary `localStorage` logic pending API implementation).
    *   Added Preset dropdown handling (`_handlePresetSelectChange`).

**Current Status:**

*   Backend authentication API (`/register`, `/login`, `/logout`, `/me`) appears functional based on direct testing (e.g., Postman).
*   Client-side registration and login via modals work correctly, interacting with the backend API.
*   Session management (login persistence via cookies) works.
*   Logged-in users see their Account Username correctly displayed in the header and the Logout button appears.
*   Logged-out users are correctly presented with the Login modal, and the main game UI is hidden.
*   **Current Problem:** After a successful login or registration, the `onLoginSuccess` function in `auth.js` fails to show the Loadout Builder, reporting a console error `[onLoginSuccess] LoadoutBuilder instance not available!`, even though other logs suggest the builder instance *was* created earlier during page load.

**Next Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Verify Builder Instance Scope/Timing:**
    *   **Confirm Assignment:** Double-check `client/js/loadoutBuilder.js` -> `DOMContentLoaded` listener ensures `window.loadoutBuilderInstance` is assigned *unconditionally* after successful instantiation.
    *   **Log Before Use:** In `client/js/auth.js` -> `onLoginSuccess`, add `console.log('Checking window.loadoutBuilderInstance before show:', window.loadoutBuilderInstance);` immediately before the `if (typeof loadoutBuilderInstance ...)` block. This will show its value *at the exact moment* it's needed.
    *   **Check Builder Constructor:** Look for any potential early exit points or silent failures within the `LoadoutBuilder` constructor itself that might prevent the global instance from being fully functional, even if no explicit error was thrown initially.

2.  **Investigate Potential Interference:**
    *   **Script Order:** Re-verify the script loading order in `index.html` one more time. Is it possible another script loaded between `loadoutBuilder.js` and `auth.js` could be overwriting `window.loadoutBuilderInstance` or causing an error?
    *   **Global Variables:** Check for any other code that might be accidentally modifying `window.loadoutBuilderInstance`.

3.  **Introduce Delay (Diagnostic):**
    *   Increase the `setTimeout` delay in `onLoginSuccess` before attempting to show the builder (e.g., `setTimeout(..., 500)`). While not a proper fix, if this *does* work, it strongly suggests a timing issue where `auth.js` runs slightly too fast after login for the builder instance to be ready/accessible globally.

Focus on Step 1 first (logging the instance value right before use) as it will give the most direct information.
