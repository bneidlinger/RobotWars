# Robot Wars - Combat Robot Types Guide

This guide introduces the various robot builds available in Robot Wars. Each robot type has unique visual components and ideal tactical approaches.

## Robot Components

Each robot in Robot Wars consists of three main components:

1. **Turret** - The weapon system mounted on top of the robot
2. **Chassis** - The main body frame that defines the robot's durability and shape
3. **Mobility** - The locomotion system that determines how the robot moves

## Available Component Types

### Turret Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Standard** | Balanced turret with medium barrel length and fire rate | All-purpose combat |
| **Cannon** | Heavy turret with high-damage, slower-firing capability | High damage at mid-range |
| **Laser** | High-tech turret with rapid-fire, lower damage per shot | Fast-paced engagements |
| **Dual** | Double-barreled turret with staggered fire patterns | Covering wider attack angles |
| **Missile** | Multi-rocket launcher with area effect potential | Tactical area control |

### Chassis Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Medium** | Standard balanced chassis with moderate armor | Versatile applications |
| **Heavy** | Reinforced chassis with enhanced durability | Absorbing damage, tank builds |
| **Light** | Streamlined chassis with reduced profile | Speed-focused builds, evasion |
| **Hexagonal** | Six-sided chassis offering balanced protection | Strategic positioning |
| **Triangular** | Forward-focused design with narrower profile | Aggressive, charging builds |

### Mobility Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Wheels** | Standard two-wheel drive offering good speed | Balanced mobility |
| **Treads** | Tank-like treads for stable movement | Consistent movement on varied terrain |
| **Hover** | Hovering system allowing omni-directional movement | Strafing and positioning |
| **Quad** | Four-wheel system with enhanced stability | Grid-pattern exploration |
| **Legs** | Spider-like legs offering unique movement | Wall hugging and ambush tactics |

## Tactical Advantages

Different component combinations provide distinct tactical advantages:

- **Spider Bot with Legs Mobility**: Excellent for hugging walls and setting up ambushes. The legs allow for precise positioning and stability when firing.

- **Rover Bot with Quad Wheels**: Great for methodical arena exploration. The quad wheel system allows smooth navigation in grid patterns while maintaining firing stability.

- **Tank Bot with Treads**: Highest durability build. The heavy chassis and treads make this build slower but exceptionally resilient under fire.

- **Spike Bot with Hover**: Maximum maneuverability. The hover system allows quick lateral movements to dodge incoming fire while maintaining attack angles.

## Programming Considerations

Different robot builds may benefit from different programming approaches:

- **Spider Bots**: Often work best with ambush tactics, wall-following algorithms, and burst damage programming
- **Rover Bots**: Excel with grid-based exploration patterns and methodical scanning
- **Tank Bots**: Benefit from defensive programming that prioritizes armor facing and controlled retreats
- **Spike Bots**: Work well with aggressive, fast-moving code focused on hit-and-run tactics

Choose your robot components to match your programming style and tactical preferences!
