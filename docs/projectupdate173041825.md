# Robot Wars Online - Project Status Update & Next Steps (Post-UI Enhancements)

**Date:** 2023-10-27

## Summary of Accomplishments (Phase 4 - UI/Layout Improvements Complete)

This phase focused on refining the user interface layout to provide a better user experience, particularly around the arena and code editor visibility.

*   **Arena Size Increased:**
    *   Goal: Provide more maneuvering room during gameplay.
    *   Implementation: Updated canvas dimensions to 900x900 in `client/index.html` and corresponding constants/logic in `server/game-instance.js` and `server/server-collision.js`.
*   **Editor & API Layout:**
    *   Goal: Maximize vertical space for the code editor.
    *   Implementation:
        *   Relocated the API Reference panel *above* the CodeMirror editor (`client/index.html`).
        *   Utilized CSS Flexbox (`display: flex`, `flex-direction: column`, `flex-grow: 1`) to allow the CodeMirror editor to expand vertically, removing its fixed height (`client/css/main.css`).
*   **Panel Height Constraints:**
    *   Goal: Further increase available space for the Arena and Editor by making secondary panels less tall.
    *   Implementation: Applied `max-height` and `overflow-y: auto` CSS properties to the "Robot Stats" and "API Reference" panels, making them scrollable if content exceeds the maximum height (`client/css/main.css`). Adjusted main grid column ratios (`grid-template-columns`) to give the Arena column more width.
*   **Robot Console Log Panel Added:**
    *   Goal: Provide players with real-time feedback from their robot's `console.log()` statements for debugging.
    *   Implementation:
        *   Added a new panel section in the HTML (`client/index.html`) below "Robot Stats".
        *   Intercepted `console.log` calls within the sandboxed robot environment on the server (`server/server-interpreter.js`) and emitted a new `robotLog` event specifically to the owner's client socket.
        *   Added a client-side listener for `robotLog` (`client/js/network.js`).
        *   Created a UI function (`addRobotLogMessage` in `client/js/ui/lobby.js`) to append messages to the new panel.
        *   Styled the new panel with a retro "Fallout terminal" theme, including green text, text-shadow, a black background, and an animated scanline effect (`client/css/main.css`).

## Next Steps Plan (Proposed Features)

Based on recent progress, here are potential features to enhance the player experience, focusing on code management and testing:

**Priority 1: Player Code Persistence & Loadouts**

*   **Goal:** Allow players to save their robot code within the browser so it persists between sessions and manage multiple named code versions ("loadouts").
*   **Considerations & Potential Implementation:**
    1.  **Storage:** Utilize browser `localStorage` as the primary mechanism. Clearly communicate its limitations (browser-specific, user-clearable, potential size limits).
    2.  **UI Elements:**
        *   Add "Save Code" / "Save As..." button near the editor. Requires prompting for a loadout name.
        *   Add a "Load Code" dropdown or list element (populated from `localStorage`) near the editor or in the header nav.
        *   Potentially add a "Delete Loadout" button/option.
    3.  **Client Logic (`controls.js` or new `codeManager.js`):**
        *   `saveLoadout(name, code)`: Gets name/code, updates `localStorage`.
        *   `loadLoadout(name)`: Retrieves code from `localStorage`, updates the CodeMirror editor.
        *   `listLoadouts()`: Reads `localStorage` keys/structure to populate the load UI.
        *   `deleteLoadout(name)`: Removes the entry from `localStorage`.
    4.  **Data Structure (localStorage):** Store loadouts as a JSON string under a single key (e.g., `robotWarsLoadouts`). The object could map loadout names to code strings: `{"MyTank": "// code...", "ScannerV3": "// code..."}`.
    5.  **Error Handling:** Implement checks for `localStorage` availability and handle potential errors (e.g., storage full).
    6.  **Interaction with Ready State:** Loading code shouldn't automatically make the player "Ready". Saving should likely be possible even while "Waiting" but disabled during "Playing/Spectating".

**Priority 2: Single-Player Test Mode**

*   **Goal:** Provide a way for players to test their robot code against a simple, predictable AI opponent without needing another human player to ready up.
*   **Considerations & Potential Implementation:**
    1.  **Initiation UI:** Add a "Test Code" button near the "Ready Up" button or editor. This button would be enabled only when the player is in the 'lobby' state.
    2.  **Server Logic (`GameManager.js`):**
        *   Need a new Socket.IO event handler (e.g., `startTestGame`).
        *   When received, `GameManager` bypasses the standard 2-player ready check.
        *   It creates a `GameInstance` specifically for the requesting player.
        *   *Crucially*, it programmatically creates a *second* `ServerRobot` instance representing the "dummy" bot. This dummy bot needs:
            *   A unique, non-socket ID (e.g., `"dummy-bot-1"`).
            *   A predefined name (e.g., "Test Bot Alpha").
            *   A simple, hardcoded AI script (see below).
            *   A standard appearance (e.g., 'default').
        *   The `GameManager` adds *both* the player's robot and the dummy robot to the `GameInstance`.
        *   Map the player to this game using `playerGameMap`. The dummy bot won't be in this map.
        *   Start the `GameInstance` loop.
    3.  **Dummy Bot AI:**
        *   Keep it simple and predictable initially. Could be hardcoded directly in `GameManager` when creating the test game instance.
        *   Example Dummy AI:
            ```javascript
            // Basic Dummy AI (Example)
            if (typeof state.dir === 'undefined') { state.dir = 0; state.timer = 0; }
            state.timer++;
            robot.drive(state.dir, 2); // Drive straight
            if (state.timer % 50 === 0) { // Turn occasionally
                state.dir = (state.dir + 45) % 360;
            }
            let scan = robot.scan(state.dir, 30);
            if (scan) { robot.fire(scan.direction, 1); } // Fire if sees something
            ```
    4.  **Game End Condition:** How does the test end?
        *   Option A: Standard rules (player or dummy destroyed).
        *   Option B: Fixed time limit (e.g., 60 seconds), requiring modifications to `GameInstance` loop/tick.
        *   Option C: Player manually stops it (needs UI button + event).
        *   Standard rules (Option A) is simplest to start. The `handleGameOverEvent` needs to gracefully handle the dummy bot "disconnecting" or not being a real player to return to lobby.
    5.  **Client UI:**
        *   The `gameStart` event needs to indicate it's a test match.
        *   Dashboard should display the "Test Bot Alpha".
        *   Chat could be disabled or prefixed "[TEST]".
        *   Lobby status text should reflect "Testing Code...".

These two features would significantly improve the development and iteration cycle for players creating their robot AI.
