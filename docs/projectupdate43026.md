# Robot Wars - Project Update

**Date:** October 26, 2023

## Summary

This update covers a recent development cycle focused on resolving critical startup errors and implementing initial visual enhancements to the Robot Wars game client. The application is now launching successfully, and core gameplay elements are functioning. New visual effects for weapon firing and projectiles have been added to improve player feedback and visual appeal.

## Fixes Implemented

Several blocking issues preventing the server and client from running correctly were identified and resolved:

1.  **Server Syntax Error (`server/routes/auth.js`):**
    *   **Issue:** A missing comma between object definitions within the `defaultSnippets` array caused a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{`.
    *   **Fix:** The missing comma was added, allowing the `auth.js` module to be parsed correctly.

2.  **Server Startup TypeError (`server/index.js`):**
    *   **Issue:** An attempt to read `sessionMiddleware.options.cookie.secure` inside the `server.listen` callback failed because the middleware function doesn't expose options that way (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'cookie')`).
    *   **Fix:** The check for secure cookies in non-production environments was moved to occur immediately after defining the `cookieOptions` object, before creating the `sessionMiddleware`. The incorrect check within `server.listen` was removed.

3.  **Database Authentication Error (`server/db.js` & Environment):**
    *   **Issue:** The PostgreSQL driver threw `Error: SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: client password must be a string`, indicating the password component of the database connection string was missing or invalid.
    *   **Fix:** This was resolved by ensuring the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (likely in the `.env` file) was correctly defined, complete, and included the proper database password. Proper loading via `dotenv` was confirmed.

4.  **Client Reference Errors (`client/index.html`, `client/js/engine/game.js`):**
    *   **Issue:** The client failed to initialize due to `ReferenceError: RobotInterpreter is not defined` and subsequently `ReferenceError: CollisionSystem is not defined`.
    *   **Fix:** The necessary script tags for `client/js/engine/interpreter.js` and `client/js/engine/collision.js` were added to `client/index.html`, and their order was corrected to ensure they load *before* `client/js/engine/game.js`, which depends on them.

5.  **Client Sound Effects Not Playing (`client/js/engine/game.js`):**
    *   **Issue:** While the background music played, the sound effects for firing, impacts, and explosions were silent.
    *   **Fix:** Calls to `window.audioManager.playSound()` with the appropriate sound keys (`'fire'`, `'hit'`, `'explode'`) were added within the `updateFromServer` method in `Game.js` when processing the corresponding `fireEvents`, `hitEvents`, and `explosions` data received from the server state update.

## New Features Implemented

Focusing on visual feedback and "eye candy":

1.  **Enhanced Robot Rendering (`client/js/engine/arena.js`):**
    *   The core robot drawing logic now renders distinct visual components (Turret, Chassis, Mobility) based on type and color selections defined in the robot's `visuals` data. This allows for the diverse robot appearances seen in the Loadout Builder.

2.  **Muzzle Flashes (`client/js/engine/game.js`, `client/js/engine/arena.js`, `server/server-robot.js`):**
    *   Added visual muzzle flash effects when robots fire.
    *   Flashes originate from the missile spawn point and point in the firing direction.
    *   Different visual styles (starburst, beam, smoke puff) are rendered based on the firing robot's `turret.type`.
    *   Flashes have a short duration and fade out.
    *   Server now includes firing direction in `fireEvents`.

3.  **Projectile Trails (`client/js/engine/arena.js`, `server/game-instance.js`):**
    *   Missiles now render with a visual trail effect.
    *   A simple fading gradient line extends behind the missile, based on its direction of travel.
    *   Server now includes missile `direction` in the `gameStateUpdate`.

## Graphics System Overview

The current graphics system is built around the **HTML5 Canvas 2D API**.

*   **Core Renderer:** `client/js/engine/arena.js` acts as the primary renderer.
*   **Layering:**
    *   A static background canvas (`backgroundCanvas`) is used for elements that don't change frequently (floor texture, grid, scorch marks). This improves performance by avoiding redrawing static elements every frame.
    *   The main dynamic canvas (`arena`) is cleared each frame and the background canvas is drawn onto it first.
    *   Dynamic elements (robots, missiles, effects) are then drawn on top in sequence.
*   **Robot Rendering:** Robots are drawn procedurally based on their `visuals` data (`turret`, `chassis`, `mobility` types and colors). Canvas transformations (`translate`, `rotate`) are used to position and orient them.
*   **Effects Management:** Visual effects (explosions, muzzle flashes) are managed as lists of objects in `client/js/engine/game.js`. Their state (position, progress, lifetime) is updated, and they are passed to the `Arena.js` renderer each frame. `Arena.js` handles the actual drawing logic for each effect type.
*   **Animation Loop:** The `Game.js` class uses `requestAnimationFrame` to drive the rendering loop, ensuring smooth updates tied to the browser's display refresh rate.

*   **Strengths:** Relatively simple to implement, good performance for the current 2D retro style, flexibility in procedural drawing.
*   **Limitations:** Requires manual drawing calls for everything, no built-in scene graph, performance can degrade with a very large number of complex objects/effects, complex lighting/shading is difficult.

## Future Graphics Improvements (Opportunities)

Building on the current system, potential future enhancements include:

*   **Enhanced Effects:**
    *   **Particle Systems:** Replace simple explosion/trail drawings with more dynamic particle effects (sparks, smoke).
    *   **Impact Effects:** Add distinct visual effects (sparks, small flashes) specifically for missile impacts on robots or walls.
    *   **Hit Flashes:** Briefly flash a robot's sprite when it takes damage.
    *   **Screen Shake:** Subtle screen shake on major explosions.
*   **Robot Visuals:**
    *   **Movement Effects:** Add thruster glows, wheel dust/sparks, or hover effects when robots move.
    *   **Damage Decals:** Visually represent damage by adding cracks, scorch marks, or smoke particle emitters to robot sprites based on their health.
    *   **Idle Animations:** Subtle visual flair (bobbing, antenna wiggle) when robots are stationary.
*   **Arena/Background:**
    *   **Animated Backgrounds:** Add subtle animations to the background texture.
    *   **Basic Lighting/Shadows:** Simple projected shadows under robots or temporary light sources from explosions/firing.
*   **UI Polish:**
    *   **CRT/Scanline Overlay:** Apply a screen-wide overlay effect for a stronger retro feel.
    *   **UI Animations:** Add subtle glows or transitions to UI elements.

## Next Steps

*   Monitor performance with the new effects active.
*   Consider implementing one or two smaller visual enhancements from the list above (e.g., Hit Flashes, Impact Sparks).
*   Continue testing core gameplay and fixing any bugs that arise.
