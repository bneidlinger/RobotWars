Phase Objective: Complete backend migration, deploy to Render, fix post-deployment issues, and integrate background music.
Technical Accomplishments:
Full Backend Migration & Deployment:
Successfully transitioned the application from client-side localStorage to a full-stack architecture using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
Implemented user accounts with password hashing (bcrypt).
Created persistent storage for user-specific Code Snippets and Loadout Configurations in the database.
Developed secure CRUD API endpoints (/api/auth, /api/snippets, /api/loadouts) protected by session-based authentication middleware.
Configured express-session with connect-pg-simple for robust PostgreSQL-backed session management.
Successfully deployed the application (Node.js Web Service + PostgreSQL DB) to Render, replacing the previous static site deployment.
Post-Deployment Bug Fixes & Refinements:
Authentication Stability: Resolved critical 401 Unauthorized errors immediately following user login/registration by correctly configuring Express to work behind Render's reverse proxy (app.set('trust proxy', 1)). This fixed issues with secure session cookie propagation.
Loadout Builder Integration: Ensured the Loadout Builder correctly fetches and displays data (configs, snippets) via API calls after successful authentication.
Editor Synchronization:
Fixed the main code editor displaying incorrect code after exiting the Loadout Builder (added logic to load the selected snippet).
Resolved the main editor appearing blank initially upon login (added editor.refresh() call).
Fixed the main editor's "Load Code Snippet" dropdown being empty (added logic to populate it post-login).
Server Stability: Addressed server crashes related to registration race conditions (duplicate keys, double client release).
Soundtrack Integration (In Progress):
Added an HTML <audio> element for background music (soundtrack.mp3) with loop attribute.
Added a volume toggle button (ðŸ”Š/ðŸ”‡) to the main UI header.
Integrated basic CSS styling for the volume button, including a .muted state.
Updated AudioManager.js to:
Reference the music element and volume button.
Manage music mute state (isMusicMuted, default set to true initially).
Persist the mute preference using localStorage (robotWarsMusicMuted key).
Include a requestMusicStart() method to initiate playback.
Updated AuthHandler.js to call audioManager.requestMusicStart() upon successful login, attempting to trigger playback within a user interaction context.
Audio Troubleshooting Summary:
Initial Issue: Following integration, neither sound effects nor background music were playing. The volume button correctly reflected the default "muted" state but toggling had no audible effect.
Console Errors: The browser developer console showed consistent errors:
Error loading sound 'fire' from /assets/audio/fire.wav (and similar for hit, explosion) - Initially observed.
After correcting code to reference .mp3 files: Error loading sound 'fire' from /assets/audio/fire.mp3 (and similar) - Persists.
NotAllowedError: play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first. - Observed for the background music attempt (requestMusicStart).
Diagnosis:
The fundamental problem is that the browser cannot load the audio files (.mp3) from the paths specified (/assets/audio/...). This prevents both sound effects and the background music from working.
The NotAllowedError for the music is now considered a symptom of the loading failure. The browser cannot play() an audio element that hasn't successfully loaded its source file, even if triggered by user interaction.
Potential causes for the loading failure:
Files are missing or misnamed in the deployed client/assets/audio/ directory.
File paths referenced in AudioManager.js (for effects) or index.html (for music) do not exactly match the actual files on the server (case-sensitivity matters).
A server configuration issue preventing static files from being served from that directory (less likely if other assets like CSS/images work).
Troubleshooting Steps Taken:
Corrected file extensions referenced in AudioManager.js from .wav to .mp3.
Fixed an unrelated LocalStorageManager not available error in editor.js.
Current Status: Audio file loading errors persist in the console. No audio is functional.
Next Troubleshooting Steps:
Verify Files: Confirm the exact existence, spelling, and case of fire.mp3, hit.mp3, explosion.mp3, and soundtrack.mp3 within the client/assets/audio directory of the deployed application on Render.
Test Direct URL Access: Attempt to access each .mp3 file directly in the browser using the full Render URL (e.g., https://robotwars-fq6c.onrender.com/assets/audio/fire.mp3). Note whether it results in a 404 error or successfully plays/downloads the file.
Confirm Code Paths: Double-check the file paths in AudioManager.js and index.html against the verified filenames.
Verify Static Serving: Ensure the express.static middleware in server/index.js is correctly configured to serve the client directory.
