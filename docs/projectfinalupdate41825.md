## Summary of Accomplishments (Phase 5 - Loadouts, Test Mode, Self-Destruct Complete)

This phase focused on improving the developer iteration loop and adding quality-of-life features.

*   **Code Persistence & Loadouts:**
    *   **Goal:** Allow players to save/load named robot code versions in the browser.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Utilized browser `localStorage` to store code loadouts as a JSON object.
        *   Added UI elements: "Save Code" button (prompts for name), "Load Code..." dropdown (populates from `localStorage`), "Delete" button (enabled when a loadout is selected).
        *   Implemented client-side logic in `controls.js` (`_getLoadouts`, `_setLoadouts`, `saveLoadout`, `loadLoadout`, `deleteLoadout`, `populateLoadoutUI`) to manage storage and UI interaction.
        *   Added status messages (`#loadout-status`) for feedback.
        *   Integrated controls with the UI state machine (enabled only in 'lobby').
        *   Added error handling for storage limits (`QuotaExceededError`).
    *   **Files Modified:** `client/index.html`, `client/css/main.css`, `client/js/ui/controls.js`.

*   **Single-Player Test Mode:**
    *   **Goal:** Allow players to test their code against a simple AI opponent without needing another player.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Added "Test Code" button to the UI (`client/index.html`, `client/css/main.css`).
        *   Client (`controls.js`, `network.js`) sends a new `requestTestGame` event with player code, name, and appearance.
        *   Server (`socket-handler.js`) listens for `requestTestGame` and calls `GameManager`.
        *   `GameManager.js` added `startTestGameForPlayer` method:
            *   Removes player from `pendingPlayers`.
            *   Generates a unique test game ID/name.
            *   Prepares data for the player and a dummy bot (using code from `dummy-bot-ai.js` and `socket: null`).
            *   Creates a `GameInstance` with both participants.
            *   Maps only the real player in `playerGameMap`.
            *   Sends `gameStart` (with `isTestGame: true` flag) only to the requesting player.
        *   Created `server/dummy-bot-ai.js` with basic movement and scan/fire logic.
        *   Modified `GameInstance.js`: Constructor handles `null` sockets; `checkGameOver` targets the specific player for `gameOver` emit in test games; `isEmpty` correctly identifies a game with only a dummy as empty.
        *   Modified `ServerRobotInterpreter.js`: Added checks for `null` sockets before emitting errors/logs.
        *   Modified client (`network.js`, `game.js`) to use `isTestGame`/`wasTestGame` flags for status updates.
    *   **Files Modified:** `client/index.html`, `client/css/main.css`, `client/js/ui/controls.js`, `client/js/network.js`, `server/socket-handler.js`, `server/game-manager.js`, `server/game-instance.js`, `server/server-interpreter.js`, `server/dummy-bot-ai.js` (new).

*   **Self-Destruct Button:**
    *   **Goal:** Provide an emergency "kill switch" for players during a match.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Added "Self-Destruct" button (`client/index.html`, `client/css/main.css`), styled distinctively (red).
        *   Modified `controls.js` (`updateUIForState`, `setupEventListeners`) to make the button visible and enabled *only* when the UI state is 'playing'. Clicking prompts for confirmation and sends a signal.
        *   Added `sendSelfDestructSignal` in `network.js` to emit `selfDestruct` event.
        *   Added server listener in `socket-handler.js` for `selfDestruct`, validating player is in a game and calling `GameManager`.
        *   Added `handleSelfDestruct` in `GameManager.js` to find the correct `GameInstance`.
        *   Added `triggerSelfDestruct` in `GameInstance.js` to apply 100 damage to the requesting robot, create an explosion, and immediately call `checkGameOver`.
    *   **Files Modified:** `client/index.html`, `client/css/main.css`, `client/js/ui/controls.js`, `client/js/network.js`, `server/socket-handler.js`, `server/game-manager.js`, `server/game-instance.js`.

## Next Steps Plan (Proposed Features)

Focusing on enhancing **fun and playability** for your friends:

**Tier 1: Core Gameplay Variety & Engagement**

1.  **Improve Test Bot AI (`dummy-bot-ai.js`):**
    *   **Goal:** Make testing more challenging and useful.
    *   **Ideas:**
        *   Add more states: e.g., 'flee' when heavily damaged, 'pursue' when target is weak, 'patrol' pattern when idle.
        *   Improve aiming: Lead targets slightly?
        *   Improve dodging: React to incoming fire (if scan detects missiles - *requires API change*) or change direction more erratically when hit.
        *   Consider different difficulty levels (maybe selectable via UI later, but start by just making the default one better).
    *   **Impact:** Low-Medium effort (mainly editing one JS file), high impact on the solo testing experience.

2.  **Arena Power-ups:**
    *   **Goal:** Add dynamic elements and tactical choices during matches.
    *   **Ideas:**
        *   Health Pack (+X health)
        *   Speed Boost (temporary +X speed)
        *   Damage Boost (temporary +X missile power)
        *   Rapid Fire (temporary reduced cooldown)
    *   **Implementation Sketch:**
        *   `GameInstance`: Maintain a list of active power-ups (`{id, type, x, y}`). Spawn them periodically at random valid locations.
        *   `ServerCollisionSystem`: Add `checkRobotPowerupCollisions`. When collision occurs, apply effect to robot, remove power-up, notify clients.
        *   `Client Arena`: Render power-ups based on game state data. Add visual/sound effect on pickup.
        *   `ServerRobot`: May need temporary state variables (e.g., `speedBoostTimer`, `damageBoostActive`).
    *   **Impact:** Medium effort (affects server logic, client rendering, potentially robot state), high impact on gameplay fun and replayability.

**Tier 2: Deeper Customization & Strategy**

3.  **Meaningful Robot Types/Abilities:**
    *   **Goal:** Make the appearance choice more than cosmetic, introducing strategic roles.
    *   **Ideas (Examples):**
        *   **Tank:** Higher base health (e.g., takes 120 damage to die), slightly slower base speed.
        *   **Spike:** Passive melee damage aura (deal small damage on `checkRobotRobotCollisions`).
        *   **Tri:** Faster turning speed, maybe slightly lower health.
        *   **Default:** Balanced stats.
    *   **Implementation Sketch:**
        *   Modify `ServerRobot` constructor/properties based on `appearance`.
        *   Update constants/logic in `ServerRobot` (speed limits), `ServerCollisionSystem` (damage calculation, collision effects), `GameInstance` (initial stats).
        *   Potentially add new API functions if needed (e.g., `activateMeleeAura()`? Or keep passive).
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High effort (touches multiple core server classes), high impact on strategic depth.

**Tier 3: Social & Meta Features**

4.  **Basic Scoring/Leaderboard:**
    *   **Goal:** Add a sense of progression and competition.
    *   **Ideas:**
        *   Simple Wins/Losses tracking displayed in the lobby.
        *   Store locally in `localStorage` (easy, per-browser) or server-side (more complex, requires file I/O or DB).
    *   **Impact:** Low (localStorage) to High (server DB) effort, Medium impact on long-term engagement.

5.  **Spectator Enhancements:**
    *   **Goal:** Make watching games more informative.
    *   **Ideas:** Click player name in stats to highlight robot? View selected robot's console log?
    *   **Impact:** Medium effort (requires client UI changes, possibly new network events), Medium impact on community feel.

**Recommendation:**

1.  Start with **Improving Test Bot AI**. It directly enhances the core coding loop you just improved with loadouts and testing.
2.  Then, implement **Arena Power-ups**. This adds immediate fun and randomness without drastically changing the core robot mechanics yet.
3.  After that, consider **Meaningful Robot Types** for deeper strategy.

This path builds complexity gradually while delivering noticeable improvements to the player experience at each stage.
