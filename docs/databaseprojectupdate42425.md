Okay, Commander. Stand down and let's consolidate the intel for your next push.
Project Tech Update: API Integration Phase Complete & Next Steps
Objective: Replace temporary client-side localStorage for code snippets and loadout configurations with API calls to the persistent backend database, enabling true user data management.
Work Completed:
Initialization Race Condition Resolved:
Refactored client/js/auth.js into an AuthHandler class with an explicit initialize() method.
Removed competing DOMContentLoaded listeners from auth.js and loadoutBuilder.js.
Centralized component instantiation (LoadoutBuilder, Game, Network, Controls, AuthHandler) within client/js/main.js's DOMContentLoaded listener, ensuring correct order.
Moved the apiCall helper function to the global scope in auth.js for accessibility by other modules.
Outcome: The Loadout Builder (window.loadoutBuilderInstance) is now reliably available when needed by the authentication flow, resolving the previous startup error.
Backend API Implementation (Snippets & Loadouts):
Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints in server/routes/snippets.js:
GET /: Fetch all snippets for the logged-in user.
GET /:snippetName: Fetch a specific snippet by name.
POST /: Create a new snippet or update an existing one (using INSERT...ON CONFLICT).
DELETE /:snippetName: Delete a specific snippet (includes check for loadout usage).
Implemented CRUD endpoints in server/routes/loadouts.js:
GET /: Fetch all loadout configurations (joining with snippets to get names) for the logged-in user.
GET /:configName: Fetch a specific loadout configuration by name.
POST /: Create a new configuration or update an existing one (using INSERT...ON CONFLICT, includes transaction for snippet ID lookup).
DELETE /:configName: Delete a specific loadout configuration.
Applied authMiddleware to all snippet and loadout routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access their data.
Database schema constraints (UNIQUE (user_id, name) for snippets, UNIQUE (user_id, config_name) for loadouts) were assumed/recommended for ON CONFLICT clauses.
Frontend API Integration (Snippets & Loadouts):
Updated client/js/controls.js:
Removed dependency on LocalStorageManager.
Replaced snippet management functions (save, load, delete, populate) with calls to the global apiCall function targeting /api/snippets endpoints.
Temporarily simplified _prepareLoadoutData and updatePlayerHeaderDisplay as they require further API integration (fetching specific configs/preferences).
Updated client/js/ui/loadoutBuilder.js:
Removed dependency on LocalStorageManager.
Replaced loadout config management functions (save, delete, populate) with calls to apiCall targeting /api/loadouts endpoints.
Replaced snippet population (populateCodeSelect) with calls to apiCall targeting /api/snippets.
Implemented local caching (this.cachedLoadouts, this.cachedSnippets) to store API results and populate UI efficiently.
Modified loadConfiguration and selection handlers to work with cached data or fetch individual items if necessary.
Removed client-side "last config" saving; this now requires backend implementation.
Current Status & Issues:
The application launches, handles registration/login correctly, and displays the Loadout Builder appropriately.
Critical Issue: Attempts to populate the Loadout Builder fail because the initial GET /api/loadouts request results in a 500 Internal Server Error.
Consequence 1: The "Load Existing Config..." dropdown in the builder remains empty.
Consequence 2: The "Use Code:" (snippet) dropdown in the builder also remains empty. This is likely due to the 500 error preventing subsequent API calls and/or because default snippets are not being created on the backend for new users.
Consequence 3: The main UI (e.g., snippet load/save buttons under the editor) may not function correctly as the initial snippet population in controls.js also fails due to the same apiCall is not defined error fixed previously, but potentially other issues related to the failed loadout fetches.
Next Troubleshooting Steps:
Diagnose GET /api/loadouts 500 Error (Highest Priority):
Action: Examine the Node.js server console output for the specific error message logged when the 500 occurs during the request to GET /api/loadouts. This will likely pinpoint the exact line and database issue.
Action: Carefully review the SQL query (including the LEFT JOIN) in the GET '/' handler within server/routes/loadouts.js. Verify all table names (loadout_configs, code_snippets), column names (user_id, config_name, code_snippet_id, etc.), and join conditions precisely match your PostgreSQL database schema. Check for typos.
Action (Optional but Recommended): Test the SQL query directly against your database using psql or a GUI tool, substituting the $1 parameter with the user_id of the affected user.
Address Default Code Snippets:
Decision: Determine if new users should automatically receive default code snippets upon registration.
Action (If Yes): Modify the user registration logic in server/routes/auth.js (POST /register). After the INSERT INTO users... query succeeds, add subsequent INSERT INTO code_snippets... queries to create the default snippets, associating them with the newly created user's ID.
Action (If No): Accept that the snippet dropdown will be empty for new users until they manually save snippets using the main editor controls.
Verify and Test:
After fixing the 500 error and (optionally) implementing default snippets, restart the server and refresh the client.
Log in as the new user. Verify that the Loadout Builder opens without the 500 error and that both the "Load Existing Config..." and "Use Code:" dropdowns populate correctly (either with defaults/existing data or empty, depending on your Step 2 decision).
Test saving a new loadout configuration and a new code snippet.
Good progress integrating the core API functionality, Commander. Focus on those server logs to squash that 500 error. Report back when you have more intel or are ready for the next phase.
