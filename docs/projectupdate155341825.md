# Robot Wars Online - Project Status Update & Next Steps

## Summary of Accomplishments (Phase 3 - Spectator Mode, History & Refinements Complete)

*   **Spectator Mode Implemented:**
    *   Clients connecting while a game is active are automatically routed to spectate that game.
    *   Spectators receive real-time `gameStateUpdate` broadcasts, seeing the match unfold.
    *   Implemented `spectateStart` and `spectateGameOver` events for managing client state transitions.
    *   Server-side logic correctly adds sockets to dedicated spectator rooms (`spectator-<gameId>`).
    *   **Lobby-to-Spectate:** Players remaining in the lobby when a new game starts are now automatically transitioned to spectate that game.
    *   **Return-to-Lobby:** Spectators are correctly moved back to the `pendingPlayers` list on the server and their UI resets to the lobby state when the spectated game ends.
*   **Game Naming:**
    *   Implemented `generateGameName()` on the server (`GameManager`) to assign thematic names (e.g., "Sector Z-138") to game instances.
    *   Game names are included in `gameStart`, `spectateStart`, and `gameStateUpdate` events, and displayed in the client UI (lobby events, dashboard).
*   **Game History Display:**
    *   Server (`GameManager`) now tracks recently completed games (name, winner, players, time) in a volatile map (`recentlyCompletedGames`).
    *   Implemented `broadcastGameHistory()` to send the sorted list of recent games to all clients upon game end.
    *   New clients receive the current history list upon connection.
    *   Client-side UI (`index.html`, `main.css`, `history.js`) added to display the received game history log in a dedicated area.
*   **State Management & Bug Fixes:**
    *   **Crucially:** Refined server-side state in `GameManager` to correctly handle game participants returning to the lobby state (adding them back to `pendingPlayers` after `gameOver`). This resolved the "Cannot submit data" error for previous players.
    *   Introduced a robust client-side UI state machine (`lobby`, `waiting`, `playing`, `spectating`) in `controls.js` to manage input enable/disable states reliably, preventing actions in incorrect contexts.
    *   Cleaned up `GameInstance` removal logic in `GameManager`.

## Next Steps Plan (Arena/UI Improvements)

**Priority 1: Increase Arena Size (50% Larger)**

*   **Goal:** Make the game arena larger for more maneuvering room. Current: 600x600 -> New: 900x900.

1.  **Client - HTML (`client/index.html`):**
    *   Update the `<canvas id="arena">` element's `width` and `height` attributes:
        ```html
        <canvas id="arena" width="900" height="900"></canvas>
        ```
2.  **Client - CSS (`client/css/main.css`):**
    *   Verify container layout adapts well to the larger canvas. No specific CSS changes anticipated for the canvas size itself.
3.  **Client - Arena JS (`client/js/engine/arena.js`):**
    *   No changes needed. Constructor reads dimensions from HTML.
4.  **Server - Game Instance (`server/game-instance.js`):**
    *   Update `ARENA_WIDTH` and `ARENA_HEIGHT` constants:
        ```javascript
        const ARENA_WIDTH = 900;
        const ARENA_HEIGHT = 900;
        ```
5.  **Server - Collision System (`server/server-collision.js`):**
    *   Update corresponding dimensions (currently hardcoded in constructor, ideally refactor to receive from `GameInstance`):
        ```javascript
        this.arenaWidth = 900;
        this.arenaHeight = 900;
        ```
6.  **Server - Robot (`server/server-robot.js`):**
    *   No changes needed (receives dimensions via `update` arguments).
7.  **Considerations:**
    *   Review/adjust robot starting positions in `GameInstance`.
    *   Potential need for gameplay re-tuning (scan range, speeds) due to larger area.

**Priority 2: Expand Code Editor & Relocate API Reference**

*   **Goal:** Give the code editor more vertical space and move the API reference list above the editor.

1.  **Client - HTML (`client/index.html`):**
    *   Move the `<div class="api-help">...</div>` block *before* the `<textarea id="code-editor">` element within `.editor-container`.
2.  **Client - CSS (`client/css/main.css`):**
    *   **Remove Fixed Height:** Remove `height: 400px;` from the `.CodeMirror` rule.
    *   **Enable Flex Grow:** Add `flex-grow: 1;` to the `.CodeMirror` rule. Ensure `.editor-container` is `display: flex; flex-direction: column;` and potentially set a `min-height` on it.
    *   **Adjust API Help Styling:** Review margins/padding for `.api-help` if needed.
    *   **Example CSS Snippet:**
        ```css
        .editor-container {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            gap: 15px;
            min-height: 500px; /* Adjust as needed */
        }

        .CodeMirror {
            /* height: 400px; /* REMOVED */
            flex-grow: 1; /* ADDED */
            border-radius: 8px;
            border: 1px solid #444;
            font-family: 'VT323', monospace;
            font-size: 16px;
            min-height: 200px; /* Optional */
        }
        ```
Use code with caution.
