Resolved GET /api/loadouts 500 Error:
Identified: Server logs indicated a "column lc.robot_name does not exist" database error. Schema inspection confirmed the loadout_configs table was missing this column.
Fixed: Executed ALTER TABLE loadout_configs ADD COLUMN robot_name VARCHAR(50); on the database.
Outcome: The 500 Internal Server Error is gone. The API call to fetch loadouts now executes successfully.
Addressed Empty Loadout Builder Dropdowns:
Identified: Even with the 500 error fixed, API calls (GET /api/snippets, GET /api/loadouts) returned empty arrays ([]) because the database contained no data for the specific user. Default code templates existed only on the client-side (LocalStorageManager) and weren't being automatically added to the database.
Fixed: Implemented server-side default snippet creation. Modified the POST /api/auth/register route (server/routes/auth.js) to:
Define the default snippets ("Simple Tank", "Scanner Bot", "Aggressive Bot") on the server.
Use a database transaction.
After successfully inserting a new user, loop through the defaults and INSERT them into the code_snippets table, associating them with the new user's ID.
Outcome: Newly registered users now automatically have the default snippets in the database. For these users, the Loadout Builder's "Use Code:" dropdown populates correctly upon opening.
Attempted Fix for Disabled UI Buttons:
Identified: After successfully using the Loadout Builder (saving config, clicking "Save & Enter Lobby"), the main UI buttons (Ready Up, Test Code, Editor controls) remained disabled, despite the application appearing to be in the correct "lobby" state.
Hypothesized Cause: A potential timing issue where the global window.isLoggedIn flag used by Controls.updateUIForState wasn't reflecting the true state accurately immediately after returning from the asynchronous Loadout Builder flow.
Attempted Fix:
Refactored AuthHandler (client/js/auth.js) to maintain its own internal _loggedIn state variable and added an isLoggedIn getter method.
Modified Controls.updateUIForState and its event listeners (client/js/ui/controls.js) to check the login status directly via the window.authHandler.isLoggedIn getter instead of the global window.isLoggedIn variable.
Outcome: The issue persists. Even with the refactoring, the main UI buttons remain disabled after returning from the Loadout Builder flow for a new user.
Project Update Snippet:
Work Completed:
Resolved critical 500 Internal Server Error on GET /api/loadouts by adding the missing robot_name column to the loadout_configs database table.
Implemented automatic creation of default code snippets ("Simple Tank", "Scanner Bot", "Aggressive Bot") in the database during user registration (POST /api/auth/register), ensuring new users have starting code available via the API.
Refactored client-side authentication state checking (AuthHandler, Controls) to use instance properties instead of potentially unreliable global flags, attempting to fix disabled UI buttons after loadout configuration.
Current Status & Issues:
Registration now correctly seeds default snippets.
The Loadout Builder successfully fetches and displays these default snippets for new users. Loadout configurations can be saved.
Critical Issue: After configuring a loadout and entering the main lobby state, the primary UI controls (Ready Up, Test Code, editor save/load/delete) remain incorrectly disabled. The previous attempt to fix this by refactoring the login state check in Controls did not resolve the behavior.
Next Troubleshooting Steps:
Diagnose why Controls.updateUIForState is not correctly enabling buttons when returning to the 'lobby' state after the Loadout Builder flow, despite the login state check refactoring. Focus on the sequence of events and state transitions triggered by LoadoutBuilder._handleEnterLobbyClick. Examine console logs from Controls.updateUIForState to see the uiState and loggedIn values being evaluated at that specific moment.
